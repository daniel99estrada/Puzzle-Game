Here are instructions on how to create new levels:

1. Puzzle-Game
2. Right-click on the Project tab in Unity Editor.
3. Select "Create" > "ScriptableObject" > "Grid Settings". This will create a new ScriptableObject asset called "Grid Settings".
4. Locate the Grid GameObject in your scene hierarchy and select it.
5. In the Inspector window, find the "Grid Settings" variable field and drag and drop the "Grid Settings" ScriptableObject asset created in step 2 onto it. This will associate the Grid Settings with the Grid GameObject.
6. With the Grid GameObject selected, locate the "Create a New Grid" button in the Inspector and click on it. This will generate a new grid with empty cells.
7. In the Inspector, you will see the individual cells of the grid. Each cell will have its own set of buttons and properties.
8. Edit each cell in the grid by modifying its properties using the provided buttons in the Inspector. Customize the cell's visual appearance, behavior, or any other relevant attributes according to your game's requirements.
9. Repeat step 7 for each cell in the grid until you are satisfied with the level design.
10. Once you are happy with your level configuration, locate the "Save Current Grid" button in the Inspector of the Grid GameObject.
11. Click on the "Save Current Grid" button to save the current grid configuration as a level.
12. Your level is now saved and ready for use in your game.

By following these instructions, you can create levels by customizing the grid cells using the provided Inspector buttons and saving the configurations when you are satisfied with the design. Repeat these steps for each level you want to create in your game.
